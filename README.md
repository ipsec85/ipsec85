### Hey, I'm Ivan!

I'm currently learning Frontend Development and looking for opportunities to put my rising skill set to use!

Since 2016, I've been working with web development in one form or another. It wasn't until the past year (2021) that my passion for web dev came to full fruition. I had the opportunity to build from scratch a site for someone. I had already been working on solifying my knowledge with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS at the time but the project required me to learn PHP and WordPress hooks on the fly. I did and put my own little creation on the interwebs. The site can be seen @ authenticallypotter.com. After that, I was hooked, pun intended. I wrote out a syllabi for myself based on industry standards and set out to learn and create.

### What I'm doing now

Currently I am learning React. I published my first React app, a card matching game, which was a great intro to the library and exposed me to a lot of the basic workings of React. I have several project ideals lined up with React that I will build, each pushing my knowledge base a little further.

After that, I plan on tackling Next.js. Currently I have my own site, realperez.com, that I want to rewrite utilizing React and Next.js.
